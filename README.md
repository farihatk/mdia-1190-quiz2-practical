A small repo for MDIA 1190 quiz 2 practical

Few important lessons I have learned in this class:
- PATIENCE. A lot of it. And I am not known to be patient c:
- Perseverence. I had so many moments I wanted to give up. And I did. But somehow I couldn't stop thinking about it and eventually would come back and try to resolve the issue
- It's okay to take a breather. Code breaks, that's normal. I have to keep telling myself that. Often it helps to get up and do something else for a refresher.
- CODING. Obviously. It's absolutely insane to me that only four months ago, I didn't even know the "C" of coding. And yet here I am, coding things under an hour and committing and collaborating on GitHub. Life really is unpredictable sometimes.
